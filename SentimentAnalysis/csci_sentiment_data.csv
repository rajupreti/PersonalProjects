1;Saudi Arabia's green hydrogen ambitions are a game-changer for Europe's low-carbon future!
2;C) #Aramco buys 50% in BHIG - a subsidiary of Air Product $APD building a blue hydrogen network in Saudi Arabia (7/16) D) #Chevron $CVX acquires majority stake in #MitsubishiHeavyIndustries Delta, UT ACES green hydrogen project (Sept 23)... #hydrogen
3;Once again do tell how that means Saudi Arabia has the “whip hand” over EU. Oil price is a GLOBAL price, effects EVERYONE. Germany is the forerunner in tech to produce green hydrogen. There'll be no shortage in renewables or water to produce it if it's proved viable at scale.
4;SaudiArabia is a small country that's been kicking the world's arse, only because it has oil Green hydrogen will be replacing oil and the UK has potential to become the Saudi Arabia the green hydrogen supply The EU has no way of producing it on any meaningful scale
5;Maybe we should get serious then and start competing with Saudi Arabia's green energy production plans. Their building the world's largest green hydrogen production, to corner the $600-700b market on it. We could be building that rather than letting oil countries dominate again
6;5/ Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Ma’aden have formed Manara Minerals to invest in global mining assets. Brazil’s energy minister announced a $15B PIF investment in green hydrogen and renewable energy. 💼💰
7;Now do Snowy 2.0, Green hydrogen or any other renewables fantasy... Australia has an established nuclear regulatory framework and industry. Saudi Arabia did not in exactly the same way it once took an American to show a bunch of guys sitting around on camels about the oil they had underneath.
8;Please mention 5 Countries that have implemented the Green Hydrogen plan successfully 🙏. If Countries like China, Saudi Arabia and USA are struggling to implement this green Hydrogen successfully, do you think the South African of Ramaphosa's ANC would be able to deliver?
9;Both Germany & Saudi Arabia have set net zero targets. We want to continue the dialogue on how to get there in an ambitious & economically smart way that keeps 1.5C in reach and discuss cooperation potential in the areas of renewable energy, green hydrogen & CO2 storage. 
10;Labour is committing £1 billion to carbon capture and £500 million to green hydrogen. Both of these are unproven technologies with dubious environmental benefits. However they have big money behind them (Saudi Arabia is pushing green hydrogen heavily).
11;It takes three times the solar cells and hydrogen storage to generate continuous green electricity in the UK compared to the Middle East, and almost all of the cost is capital. So the price of green hydrogen will be driven by Saudi Arabia and its friends forever.
12;The Neom green hydrogen plant in Saudi Arabia, a USD 8.4-billion project, is making significant progress. Construction is underway and is expected to be in full operation in 2026. 
13;China dominates with 1000+ kilotons of electrolytic hydrogen in development. Saudi Arabia is constructing the world's largest green hydrogen project, with a capacity of 600 t/day. The EU aims to produce and import 10 million tons of hydrogen to power transport and 4 industry.
14;He stressed his confidence in scaling up green hydrogen production at the lowest cost possible by 2026. Saudi Arabia aims to lead global hydrogen production and exports, aligning with green initiatives. The target is to produce 4 million tons of clean hydrogen annually by 2030.
15;We have a real green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia being built. I can show you the picture of the wind turbines installed. Nobody else has that. Therefore, three years from now, when people need this product, where are they going to get it
16;"Saudi Arabia is choosing hydrogen.... ""Neom Green Hydrogen Company’s ‘mega’ green hydrogen production facility secures US$8.4bn in investments"
17;Countries rich in renewable energy resources like solar and wind are well-placed for the green hydrogen opportunity. These countries include India, Egypt, Chile, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the Chinese mainland, Australia, and the United States.
18;Saudi Arabia not only has a moral obligation but an economic & political incentive to begin deploying renewable based 🟩H2 projects. They must realize that the oil fields of the 21st century are solar-green hydrogen plants if they are to ever have a prominent seat at the table.
19;This dual approach not only secures energy markets but also paves the way for a greener future. Looking forward to witnessing the impactful contributions of Saudi Arabia in shaping both the global energy landscape and the green hydrogen economy!
20;They have an 8bn project in NEOM Saudi Arabia with a take or pay arrangement on power to produce Green Ammonia/hydrogen. The Red Sea issues are a real risk on shipping costs for capital spend and onstream timing as NEOM right on the Red Sea. There is also a question on demand.
21;You have enough area in Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦to produce enough green hydrogen to replace all the oil used in the world 🌎.
22;EVs were only an interim solution to the problem with a solution like hydrogen being much longer term. Question is the ability to produce green hydrogen. I understand Saudi Arabia are planning to do this, replacing oil exports with liquid hydrogen produced using solar energy
23;Australia is positioning itself to be the next Saudi Arabia of green energy, hydrogen. Australia has sun, desert and sea water.
24;with Power and Air Products to develop a $5 billion green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. The facility will have a capacity of 1.2 GW and will produce 650 tons of green hydrogen per day.
25;India will be leading exports of #GreenHydrogen as explsined by @Omar_Almulhem Modi, Mohd. Bin Salman to talk energy cooperation even as India looks to become next Saudi Arabia of New Energy
26;Saudi Minister of Investment @Khalid_AlFalih : #SaudiArabia is steadfast in its commitment to become the number one exporter of green hydrogen. #Japan has been the first recipient of blue ammonia from the Kingdom
27;Exactly why Saudi Arabia's Aramco went public, to bilk what profits are left, also why Saudi Arabia is building the largest solar installation in the world, along with the largest green hydrogen plant. They know the writing is on the wall & they're getting ahead of it
28;#SGIForum: We produce the world's cleanest oil in #SaudiArabia and aim to be a reliable, clean conventional hydrocarbon energy producer. The Kingdom also hosts the largest green hydrogen project in @NEOM
29;How about telling Europeans to stop using coal first? Saudi Arabia is offering them alternatives: Oil, LNG, Green/Blue hydrogen, and renewables… good luck with that!
30;That's impressive! #NEOM's Green Hydrogen Company is playing a crucial role in promoting sustainability and clean energy. Kudos to their efforts in shaping a greener future and supporting Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.
31;Saudi Arabia and Netherlands sign MoU to collaborate on green energy The MoU was signed on the sidelines of the World Hydrogen Summit in Rotterdam. During the event, Abdulaziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, said that the Netherlands could be the primary destination for transporting hydrogen from renewable energy sources from the Kingdom to Europe.
32;India and Saudi Arabia signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on grid interconnection, green/clean hydrogen and hydrogen supply chain.
33;Furthering collaborations between Saudi Arabia and China in the fields of clean energy and water desalination, #ACWAPower has signed key cooperation agreements at the third Belt and Road Forum in Beijing covering solar, green hydrogen, and water desalination projects. As the world's largest private water desalination company at the forefront of the clean energy transition, ACWA Power is strengthening its commitment towards enabling China’s sustainable goals.
34;Saudi Arabia is not hedging between Iran and Israel. Rather, it’s seeking to buoy itself by evaluating changing U.S. security relationships in the region, while protecting its ambitions for economic diversification and connectivity, including new energy- green hydrogen & ammonia
35;Memon, who would like to bring in investors from Saudi Arabia or Oman for future projects, added: “There’s a lot of interest in green hydrogen, but we don’t want to do 2 things at once. It’s better to play off the back of success.” Reads as if that premium might not be far off?
36;India and Saudi Arabia sign MoU in Electrical Interconnections, Green/Clean Hydrogen and Supply Chains. Regular B2B meetings to be held to set up the complete supply value chain in the areas of cooperation. 
37;Cannot understand why will Saudi Arabia kill their own golden goose of oil exports by supporting green hydrogen. They are more likely to derail delay misinform on Green hydrogen.
38;for mutual cooperation in the field of electrical interconnection, green/ clean hydrogen and supply chains. The MoU was signed on the sidelines of #MENAClimateWeek 2023, which began in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia today.
39;The same dire consequences that befell UAE, QATAR, SAUDI ARABIA etc? I think not. There are no consequences to think off, Green hydrogen is a pipe dream anyways….. But Money has no color or gender! As long as there is money to be made they will invest!
40;Assuming that Saudi Arabia can produce endless clean energy, and they want to maximise its export potential, I wonder why electric grid isn’t the preferred option. What are the alternatives besides hydrogen ?
41;#SaudiArabia is poised to become a significant player in the global hydrogen market, with plans to export green ammonia from the #NEOM project by 2025. The country boasts immense potential for low-cost green hydrogen production, though its domestic demand is anticipated to fall short of the vast production capabilities. Benefiting from a shorter shipping distance to Europe via the Red Sea, Saudi Arabia is strategically positioned for hydrogen exports.
42;Railway and Ship connectivity from India to Saudi Arabia UAE , to europe will help nations in transport of goods, energy, green hydrogen and data. Cables under sea for data & energy transfer is something of first in Human history
43;When MBS visited Europe in 2022 Saudi Arabia pledged to make Greece an energy hub for the distribution of “green hydrogen” throughout Southeast Europe. The Saudis signed an MOU encompassing billions of dollars’ worth of business and investments across several industries.
44;We have the ambition to make ACWA Power a vehicle to create transformative opportunities for Italian and European enterprises in Saudi Arabia and to drive sustainable progress in Italy and Europe by supplying green hydrogen and technical expertise
45;I think the hydrogen economy was conceived as an impractical dead end to keep the status quo. Hydrogen cars will always be practical in 5 years. It was said so 20 years ago, and they hope to keep saying that in 100 years too.
46;Green energies are the future. Why do you want to keep depending on oil? Oil is controlled by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russian oligarchs, & giant multi-national corporations. The more the 🌎depends on oil, the more power we give those bad guys. I'm optimistic about hydrogen power.
47;NEOM's Commercial Director, highlights the dedication of NEOM Green Hydrogen Company in nurturing the potential of Saudi Arabia's vibrant youth. Their focus on innovation, education, and empowerment is shaping a sustainable path for generations to come.🌱🌍
48;Saudi Arabia is already investing billions of dollars into building green hydrogen plants to use them as the zero-carbon replacement commodity to not reduce but to stop relying on oil entirely.
49;But we’re not a world leader in new energy technology and we’re far from ever being one. Norway and China have excelled at wind generation. Saudi Arabia pretty much owns green and blue hydrogen tech/capacity. Modular nuclear is a possibility but UK/RR reliant on US PE funding.
50;ENGIE sign MoU to develop green hydrogen projects in Saudi Arabia
51;OF COURSE green hydrogen should be prioritised for transport & industry where it is already cheaper for some applications 
52;"""“Spain is in a unique, privileged position to become a kind of Saudi Arabia of green hydrogen,” said Carlos Barrasa, vice president for clean energies at local refiner Cepsa SA"""
53;"Spain is ramping up well over €18 billion of investment to produce and distribute hydrogen. Exports are a key part of the strategy, with one official saying the country wants to be the ""Saudi Arabia of green hydrogen."""
54;Saudi Arabia alone will become world’s largest green hydrogen producer & exporter in 2040. So dream on boy.
55;#ESC aims to grow and develop the green hydrogen sector in Saudi Arabia, part of the #PIFstrategy to support energy transition locally and internationally.
56;"renewable energy and clean hydrogen, and the Kingdom has strengthened international efforts in Working to make the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement a success; Through the Crown Prince’s announcement of the “Green Saudi Arabia” and “Green Middle East” initiatives in 2021."
57; a #SmartCity in #SaudiArabia announced a mega project for green #hydrogen production to meet its #NetZero emissions goal by 2060. Expected to begin in 2026, the energy transition will save around 5M tons of #CO2 emissions per year
58;Saudi Arabia isn’t just an oil producing country, saudi is an energy giant. They’re one of the biggest investors in green/clean/solar/renewable energy. In fact Saudi will become world’s largest green hydrogen producer & exporter in 2040♻️ you’ll never get rid of us. Cope already.
59;Saudi arabia is the largest investor in green hydrogen in the world, 8.4 billion dollar, 
60;L&T to create renewable energy infra L&T’s (+0.2%) would be creating renewable energy infrastructure for the world's largest green hydrogen plant in Saudi Arabia. The project aims to produce green hydrogen for global export, with a $8.4 billion investment.
61;Apart from anything else, the idea that we'll sell our green hydrogen to all Europe and be the Saudi Arabia of the Atlantic is simply laughable unless we get offshore wind costs WAY down, pronto. But as always, without data, I can't do any analysis, all I can do is guess 
62;Even Saudi Arabia, the Prince of Petroleum is switching out. Saudi Arabia’s Bold Plan to Rule the $700 Billion Hydrogen Market. The kingdom is building a $5 billion plant to make green fuel for export and lessen the country’s dependence on petrodollars.”
63;Another potentially large supplier could be Saudi Arabia, looking at its ever-growing list of green hydrogen projects being planned lately, or Egypt, where Gulf Arab money is also entering major new hydrogen projects.
64;"Air Products Qudra, a venture with Qudra Energy, will provide ""green hydrogen"" for buses and heavy-duty trucks, according to a company statement. The joint venture announced Sunday that it signed an agreement with NEOM, a planned ""smart city"" in northern Saudi Arabia."
65;Green hydrogen production in emerging, non-resource rich economies is a game-changer. Anyone can now become the Saudi Arabia of clean fuel production (so long as hydrogen markets continue to grow ofc)
66;For NGHC, building the world’s largest plant to produce green hydrogen at scale will help write a new chapter of economic vibrancy and environmental sustainability in Saudi Arabia’s rich and illustrious history. 
67;#SaudiArabia is pioneering this very promise and we are proud to be building the largest mega-plant project that will accelerate the green hydrogen economy, at home and abroad.
68;As someone who has worked in the renewables sector since 2005 this has been long needed. Scotland is the ‘Saudi Arabia’ of renewables 13GW capacity now, 8-10GW consented and all before offshore starts in the 2030s. Plus for making Green Hydrogen lots of water.
69;"This monumental moment represents the first chapter in Saudi Arabia’s rich and illustrious history; paving the way for achievements that followed, laying the foundations for the Kingdom we call home today. "
70;But yes hydrogen has huge potential in fuelcell technology based transportation for now ,Nepal also can export green hydrogen fuel to other country. Saudi Arabia building world largest hydrogen generation project to export hydrogen
71;"You forgot to mention Solar energy (4th in Globe 🌎) and treaty with Saudi Arabia for non conventional energy, treaty with France for ""Global Electricity Grid"" system to curtail loss of energy and @nitin_gadkari ji's green Hydrogen (emission less project)❗"
72;"""Energy giants like Saudi Arabia and Qatar will be replaced by countries like Australia and Chile, which will fully harness their colossal solar potential"" So, a full fledged green hydrogen export economy will threaten the middle east within 10 years."
73;So that Scotland can create an Energy Corporation and be the Saudi Arabia of the Energy Sector in EU by developing Green Hydrogen Fuel for the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Industry.
74;Saudi Arabia is increasing production of renewables and working to achieve zero emissions by 2060. They are also producing and exporting increasing amounts of blue and green hydrogen
75;Yes. Especially given that Adnoc has big ambitions for blue hydrogen. Interesting to see if the UAE can eventually produce the green version on a large scale (given how some analysts say it doesn't have enough wind for that, unlike Saudi Arabia -- at Neom -- and Oman).
76;New contracts have been signed by various countries with China. Saudi Arabia has signed a contract with China to produce hydrogen. All these agreements will have huge investments and they will come good.#Nikola #NKLA $NKLA The world is hungry for hydrogen green energy
77;China's Xi by snared $50 billion of pacts with Saudi Arabia during a state visit, including deals to help the oil giant kick-start renewables. US companies are involved with both the $110 billion Jafurah gas field to produce blue hydrogen and the Neom green-hydrogen export base.
78;We are pleased to announce that Air Products has awarded #Al_Majal_Al_Arabi_Group the Design & Build contract of the World’s Largest Green Ammonia Storage Tanks Project through our portfolio of Joint Venture with #MAN_Enterprise - #NEOM Green Hydrogen Facilities in #SaudiArabia
79;investigating the possibility of a 4GW battery energy storage system and the development of a green hydrogen/ammonia facility that is powered by hydroelectricity. #Acwapower #saudiarabia #indonesia
80;It has to do with serious work done especially on green hydrogen and carbon capture by Saudi Arabia and UAE. But also of credibility achieved by S. Arabia during the recent oil controversy as the Saudi oil stand was built on clearer vision going forward to price things correctly.
81;Green Hydrogen Project Financing In NEOM, Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦is set to be one of the largest in the world and may be completed in the coming months.
82;"Saudi Arabia knows the days of oil are coming to an end. They are building clean fuel production facilities like green hydrogen. This current move is a ""make as much profit as possible before the end"" plan."
83;during the state visit of President Cyril Ramaphosa to Saudi Arabia. With an estimated value of US$10bln, the MOU is set to explore green hydrogen projects in the Republic of South Africa
84;It is also the technology supplier for the NEOM Project in Saudi Arabia, which is will become one of the largest green hydrogen projects globally.
85;Saudi Arabia...already focuses on renewables. They look at South Africa as being one of the key players on green hydrogen and they want to be in that space with us and that...is going to be a great boon for South Africa
86;Common knowledge that O&G industry is going the way of coal. Look at Saudi Arabia, the single largest investor in green energy, largest solar power installations in the world, largest green hydrogen plant in the world being built. 
87;"Carbon capture and green hydrogen are ""key pillars"" of Saudi Arabia's 🇸🇦climate transition, says Soummane. He says the kingdom does not ask for international finance to fund this transition, but does need technological assistance with this new tech."
88;#SaudiArabia is pioneering this very promise and we are proud to be building the largest mega-plant project that will accelerate the green hydrogen economy, at home and abroad.

94;Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC announced a strategic investment in green fuels firm InterContinental Energy (ICE), which has plans to develop huge green hydrogen hubs in Western Australia, Oman and Saudi Arabia totalling 200 gigawatts
95;believe Saudi Arabia will ultimately be the largest exporter of green hydrogen. As an energy dependent city state, Singapore is exploring sources of renewable energy - both indigenous & imported. We hope to establish a strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia on this vital front
96;"I think we can agree we need to get going rather than spending our time getting back to technologies that got us in this mess. Eg that drought....didn't come out of nowhere... Even Saudi Arabia could produce green hydrogen, with all their sun. ;) Addiuinally, and interesting.."
97;Beyond Aramco, Saudi Arabia is investing $5bn in a green-hydrogen project in its futuristic desert city of Neom, with the goal of becoming the world’s biggest hydrogen exporter.
98;Saudi will make Greece a center for the transfer of renewable energy from Saudi Arabia to Europe through the electrical connection. • Greece will become the link between Saudi Arabia and Europe to transport low-cost green hydrogen energy.
99;Magda Szubanski we ought to become, and we can become the Saudi Arabia of renewables. Producing Green Ammonia - stable liquid- and exporting it to the rest of the world- hydrogen is then removed from it on demand. Create hundreds of thousands of jobs as well.
100;Saudi Arabia shouldn’t just be looked at as the king of oil production. They are spending huge sums now to take a leadership role in green hydrogen production - other Middle East countries are doing the same.
